---

### 🖼️ Features (Static)
✅ Pixel-perfect layout replication.

✅ Responsive design with CSS Grid/Flexbox.

Framework: React (via Vite)

Styling: CSS Modules for scoped styles

CSS Grid & Flexbox

Media queries for breakpoints

Layout shifting for sidebar, cards, and columns

## 📤 Deployment Info
Platform: Vercel
